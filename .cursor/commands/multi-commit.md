Now write a summary of the uncommited changes.

Then show me the summary, and wait for me to approve before you proceed.

When I do approve, consider the summary and look through code, and determine which atomic changes can be committed one by one. Proceed and commit each change with its own commit message.

_IMPORTANT_: Do NOT use `git reset`, `git checkout`, or any other commands that could modify the files in the repo.

_Only_ use `git log`, `git status`, `git diff`, `git add`, and `git commit` commands.

** If you need to use other sommands ** then ask for permission first.
