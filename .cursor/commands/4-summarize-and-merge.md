Write a summary of this branch for the merge commit.

Give it a title that succinctly communicates the areas touched. For example:

"Error taxonomy; Parser validation pipeline; Runtime cleanup; Git Staging & Testing; Agent Commands."

Write a summary. Infer the rationale for significant changes when possible, and include it.

For each area/significant change, write a _short_ subsection that explains the change. Don't repeat what's in the commit history; instead add or compress information. Reference specific commit hashes as relevant.

Finally, ask me to review, before attempting to merge into main with the above summary as the commit message. If there are any merge conflicts, notify me before completing the merge.
