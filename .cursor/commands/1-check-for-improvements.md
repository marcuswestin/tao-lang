Take a thorough look at the staged changes (and immediately related code), and see if there are any fixes, cleanups, or improvements that could be made before committing. Write a short summary, along with suggested changes to resolve them.

When you make improvements, don't stage them yet. Just implement them and leave them for me to review and stage.
