Implement the referenced spec file.

Don't trust any of the supplied information blindly. Thorougly ask clarifying questions before proceeding with the implementation.

If you run into any ambiguities or questions while planning or implementing, ask for clarification rather than guessing.

ALWAYS add TODOs in the spec file for missing tasks before implementing them.

Use the appropriate cursor rule for guidance.
