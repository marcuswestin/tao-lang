Write me a summary of the uncommited changes.

Then, update TODO.md accordingly, and move the newly resolved tasks to TODO.Resolved.md, under an appropriate section. (Create the section if it doesn't exist.)

Don't stage the changes yet. Just implement them and leave them for me to review and stage.
