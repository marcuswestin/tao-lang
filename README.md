### Get started

Run this to get started:

```zsh
zsh .config/automated-setup.zsh
```

### Extension Development

Watch for changes to the grammar:

    `just watch-grammar`

And then (re)install the extension:

    cmd+shift+b (rebuilds the extension)

And finally reload it in the command palette:
(I have this bound to cmd+shift+h, right about b)

    Developer: Restart Extension Host
